# BankingSoftware

Using Apache NetBeans 13 and Java, I created banking software that incorporates fundamental software engineering principles. This application is designed to assist with managing, viewing, and transferring funds across various scenarios and user types. It features capabilities for transferring money between accounts and storing user data for convenient access, along with login functionalities for Clients, Managers, Employees, Administrators, and others.

I applied skills such as advanced software engineering, UML-based design, and UI/UX design throughout the project. Additionally, the later versions of the software utilize polymorphism.
