# BankingSoftware

With the help of Apache NetBeans 13 and Java, I developed banking software that utilises core software engineering skills. This software can help manage, view and transfer funds for multiple use cases and personas. This includes transferring funds between accounts and saving user information for ease-of-access, and includes logins for Clients, Managers, Employees, Administrators, etc.

Skills like high-order software engineering, UML-based design and UI/UX design have been used. The later iterations of the project employ polymorphism, as well.
